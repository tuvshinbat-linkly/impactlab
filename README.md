# impactlab
Impact LAB is a social innovation hub — a dynamic hybrid space where changemakers across sectors come together to connect, create, and grow.

What is Impact LAB?
Impact LAB is a multifunctional event space designed for cross-sector collaboration. Our modular venue hosts workshops, skill-shares, pop-up services, product pilots, exhibitions, panels, and community labs — giving independent talents a stage to teach and showcase, and companies a place to run demos, deliver services, and engage directly with the community. We make it easy for different industries to collaborate, experiment, and get rapid feedback, turning one-off events into ongoing partnerships and real-world solutions.

What you can do at Impact LAB (quick bullets):
Host workshops, trainings, and masterclasses.
Run pop-up service desks or product pilots (free trials, consultations, demos).
Hold exhibitions, film screenings, and gallery nights.
Deliver community clinics, recruitment or CSR activations.
Run hackathons, co-creation labs, and prototyping sessions.
Stage showcases where freelancers and talents teach or sell services.
Test market products or gather user feedback with real audiences.
Organise cross-sector roundtables and partnership sprints.

Our Vision
We believe in a Mongolia where business and creativity solve social problems. Impact LAB connects people, ideas, and resources to create sustainable change.

Why It Matters
Lack of awareness about social enterprises in Mongolia


Limited platforms for collaboration between individuals, NGOs, and businesses


Need for responsible, purpose-driven business models
 Impact LAB is the answer — a living example of how sustainability, creativity, and community come together.
